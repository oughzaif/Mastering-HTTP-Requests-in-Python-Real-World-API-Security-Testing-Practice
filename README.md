# Mastering HTTP Requests in Python: Real-World API & Security Testing Practice

Welcome to this practical Python project where I demonstrate how to work with HTTP methods—GET, POST, and HEAD—using real-world test APIs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains three Python scripts that help me practice:

- Fetching data using **GET** requests.
- Sending data using **POST** requests.
- Inspecting HTTP headers using **HEAD** requests.

I interact with safe, public test endpoints:

- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) — a fake REST API for testing.
- [VulnWeb Test Site](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/) — a security test website for educational purposes.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.11+
- `requests` library for HTTP requests
- Public test APIs for safe experimentation

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals & Level

- Comfortable with sending and receiving HTTP requests.
- Able to parse JSON responses and handle different HTTP methods.
- Currently at an **Upper Beginner** level, working towards **Intermediate** skills in web scraping and API interactions.
- Focus on ethical and legal use of web scraping and testing techniques.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
All APIs used are publicly available test services.  
Please respect website policies and use scraping techniques responsibly.

## 📂 Files

- `get.py` — Performs GET requests to fetch data.  
- `post.py` — Sends POST requests to create data.  
- `head.py` — Uses HEAD requests to examine HTTP headers.
